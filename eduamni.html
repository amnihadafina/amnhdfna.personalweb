                <h3>Sekolah Kebangsaan Jejawi</h3>
                <p>I began my primary education at SK Jejawi, Kangar, Perlis, from 2010 to 2016. This is where I built the foundation of my learning, starting with preschool and ending with the UPSR examination.This was where countless childhood memories were created, ones I will never forget. From playing with friends during recess to participating in school events, every moment remains close to my heart. Alhamdulillah, I concluded my time there with excellent UPSR results, marking a memorable end to my primary school journey. </p>

                <h3>Sekolah Menengah Kebangsaan Syed Ahmad</h3>
               <p>From 2017 to 2022, I continued my education at SMK Syed Ahmad, Tambun Tulang, Perlis. I was in the religious studies stream from Form 1 to Form 5, Alhamdulillah, with Allah's will, I pursued a field I truly love. Due to the distance from home to school, I stayed in the hostel throughout my secondary school years.</p>
               <p>SMK Syed Ahmad was a turning point for me, where I stepped out of my comfort zone. During school, I was quite active in leadership roles. I was appointed as a prefect, Head of the Girls' Hostel Students (ASPURI), and the Head of the Committee for the BADAR association. </p>        
                <p>I was also active in public speaking, representing my school in state-level (Perlis) religious speech competitions and Arabic speech competitions in 2017, where I won a silver medal. Alhamdulillah. Additionally, I often served as an emcee for official school events and had the opportunity to host the 2019 Student Excellence Awards ceremony in Arabic. </p>       
                <p>Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, my friends and I sat for the SPM examination in 2022. Alhamdulillah, with the guidance of the teachers at SMKSA, my friends and I achieved excellent results in SPM.</p>

                <h3>Universiti Teknologi Mara Kedah</h3>
                <p>In 2022, I embarked on a new chapter of my educational journey, pursuing higher education at Universiti Teknologi MARA (UiTM), Kedah Branch, located in Merbok, Sungai Petani. I was offered a place in the Diploma in Information Management (IM110) program.</p>
                <p> Throughout my diploma studies, I explored a variety of subjects, including Introduction to Information Skills & Management, Records Management, Computer System Operations, Islamic Information Management, Cataloging, Programming, Database, and many more. Each subject enriched my knowledge and prepared me for the industry.One of the highlights of my diploma was completing a two-month internship at Jabatan Agama Islam Perlis, where I gained hands-on experience and applied what I had learned in class.</p> 
<p>Over these 2.5 years, I have gained invaluable knowledge and guidance from my dedicated lecturers, and I truly cherish the supportive friends who have been my constant cheerleaders along the way. This diploma journey has been nothing short of amazing, filled with unforgettable memories, late-night study sessions, and moments of laughter. As we near the end of this chapter, I pray that my friends and I will complete our diploma with flying colors. Aamiin Ya Mujib! </p>
